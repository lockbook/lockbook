Write notes, sketch ideas, and store files in one secure place. Share seamlessly, keep data synced, and access it on any platform—even offline. Lockbook encrypts files so even we can’t see them, but don’t take our word for it: Lockbook is 100% open-source.

## Community-Driven
Lockbook is in open beta. Join our community, share your feedback, and help achieve our vision of open-source privacy without compromises.

## Private & Secure
Keep your thoughts to yourself! Lockbook uses elliptic curve cryptography (just like Bitcoin) to hide your data even from us. Your files never leave your device without being encrypted with your private key. Your private key is generated on your device and transferred directly to your other devices by scanning a QR code or typing a 24-word phrase.

## Transparent
Be the customer, not the product. We sell a note-taking app, not your data.
| Storage    | Price         |
|------------|---------------|
| Up to 25MB | Free          |
| Up to 30GB | $2.99 / month |
| Above 30GB | Coming soon   |

Lockbook compresses your files before measuring your usage. Compressed text files are smaller by 5x or more so you can store the entire Harry Potter book series in our free tier. Less compressible formats like PDFs and images will count closer to their full size.

## Developer-Friendly
The Lockbook CLI will fit right into your favorite chain of piped-together Unix commands. Search your notes with `fzf`, edit them with `vim`, and schedule backups with `cron`. Our Rust library `lb-rs` has bindings for C and Java. Lockbook creates documents in Markdown and SVG, open formats that lend themselves to extensibility and automation.
