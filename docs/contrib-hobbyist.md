# As a hobbyist
Lockbook is very [extensible](extending.md). Backing up, syncing and collaborating bytes in different places is at the heart of most projects. See how far you can get by keeping all your bytes under the same (trustworthy) roof. Reach out to us if any of our APIs are falling short. Show off what you built in our discord! Here are some of our favorite contributions:
* [Custom Clients written in GoLang by Steve](https://github.com/steverusso/lockbook-x)
* [Backing up dotfiles by Corey](https://coreycc.com/md/blog/backup-dotfiles-with-lockbook.md)

Experiments that were ultimately added to Lockbook itself:
* [Mind Map by Krish](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook/pull/3187) 
* [Space Analyzer by Arav](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook/pull/3474)
