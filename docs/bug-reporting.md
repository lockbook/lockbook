# You found a bug!
First of all, we're sorry. 

Please tell us about this bug! As the person encountering this bug your only obligation is to persist the information about this bug somewhere.

If you have a Github account you can create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook/issues/new) and someone on our team will be in touch. Here are some ways you can help us:
- Search to see if the issue exists already. Feel free to add more information to the original issue, even if it's just a reaction to tell us that this is something you'd like fixed.
- If possible (or relevant) try to capture a video of you encountering the problem. Try to provide us with steps to reproduce the problem.
- Go into settings, and copy the "debug info". It will contain no secrets, should be short enough for you to review. If possible, please attach this to your bug report. This contains the answer to a number of the questions we'd like to ask you (like what platform you're on, or what was the nature of the last crash Lockbook encountered).
