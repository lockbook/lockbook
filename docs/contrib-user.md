# As a user

Once you have Lockbook [installed](installing.md), you can contribute to Lockbook by using it and sharing with like minded people who share our [values](values.md).

Finding bugs and [reporting them to us](bug-reporting.md) is a great way to help make Lockbook better.

As you use our product if you have insight that you think would help you use Lockbook in more ways, or allow you to use Lockbook with more people we'd love to hear from you on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/lockbook).

At the moment we're a completely out-of-pocket funded operation and your financial support goes a long way. Use the app and convert to premium if you're sold on our product.

If you'd like to make a more substantial contribution reach out to us on Discord.
