# Contributing

Lockbook is grass-roots open-source project that began in 2020. We're on a mission to create a sustainable business guided by [values](values.md) we believe will create better software.

If these values resonate with you and you'd like to join us, we'd be honored to have you be a part of this journey.

You can contribute to lockbook simply by using it, thinking deeply about the product and giving us feedback. If you enjoy using Lockbook, sharing it with like minded people also is immensely helpful. See more [here](contrib-user.md).

Lockbook is built to be [extensible](extending.md). We welcome traditional forms of open source contributions. Things like building bindings to the lb-rs library in new languages, packaging lockbook for new platforms, or just building interesting workflows on top of Lockbook using our CLI and writing about your experiences in a blogpost are all great ways to help grow the project. See more [here](contrib-hobbyist.md).

Finally if you're a software engineer with expertise in Rust, Kotlin or Swift (the primary languages that Lockbook is written in) and you're interested in contributing to any of our research-grade problems checkout [this](contrib-programmer.md).

# Contrib basics
If you have a bug, our priority is to make it as easy to receive that bug as possible. You can join our [discord](https://discord.gg/lockbook) and report it there, or you can create a [github issue](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook/issues), and from there a maintainer will triage it further.

Similarly most discussions / questions happen on discord. Don't be shy, hop in and start a conversation!
