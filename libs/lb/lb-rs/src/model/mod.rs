//! Members of this module specialize in "pure" representation of ideas
//! these could be just where our data model lives or could be expressions
//! of complicated algorithmic or abstract ideas. If you're writing code
//! in this module it's expected that you optimize for portability by not
//! using IO, not using async, and generally staying away from locks. It's
//! expected that code in this module is reasonably easy to test as well.
