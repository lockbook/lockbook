Privacy Policy
==============

Apart from a few exceptions, all data you enter into Lockbook is only visible to you or your collaborators.

Your username is visible to us in plain text.

File names & documents are encrypted so only you or your collaborators can see them. We can see the size of your documents after they’ve been compressed and encrypted.

We can see the shape of your file tree, and we know when a file is updated. We can tell which version of the code you’re running.

When you sign up for our premium tiers, some information is sent to a payment processor, and we only store the ids that the payment processor replies with.

We do not store emails, credit cards, addresses, or any personally identifiable information.

You may delete your account through settings on most platforms.

We do not co-operate with state actors unless we are ordered by a court to do so.
