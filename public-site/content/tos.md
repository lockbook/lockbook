Terms of Service
================

This is a legal agreement between you and Lockbook LLC regarding your use of Lockbook’s Servers. You agree to this policy by creating an account on our server.

An account’s data or private keys cannot be recovered by Lockbook staff. Lockbook servers can undergo maintenance at any time. In the rare event of a failure, Lockbook’s server administrators may need to delete data to restore system integrity. Lockbook administrators may, in our sole discretion, suspend or delete accounts engaging in malicious usage of our server.

You may not juggle multiple free accounts to avoid paying for our free tier. If your premium account enters a delinquent state, files in the premium tier are subject to deletion.

All software written by Lockbook is released under the [Unlicense license](https://unlicense.org/). A copy of it is attached at the bottom of this agreement.

Any data transmitted to Lockbook servers are outlined in our [privacy policy](/privacy-policy). Lockbook will only engage with authorities when ordered to by a court that has jurisdiction over our employees, see our [annual warrant canary](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook/blob/master/docs/canary.md). All source code is open source and [auditable](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook) by the public.
